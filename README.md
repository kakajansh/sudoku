###sudoku game
----------

Actually i made that project as an interest to C# programming and Visual Studio development cycle. So you are free to fork copy paste smh else.. Project is all about creating elements on FormLoad and shows you how to **Organize, Access, Change** toolbox element properties.

**Work mechanism**

>- Some default forms initially created
>- User chooses whether 4x4 or 9x9 type
>- App creates forms on chosen game type
>- Then simple simply checks user input (sudoku rules) 

**Logic** is pretty simple

>- **Area checking** - create some panels depending on board size and place textbooks on it.
>- **Hor & Ver checking** - get X and Y axis from textboxes Location property.

**Screnshoot**
